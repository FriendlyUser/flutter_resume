A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code

## Explaination

This is suppose to be a repo for me to learn how to use Dart and Flutter and resume generation.

Seems like a plain resume format is far better for text based extraction.

Have a seperate copy of my resume for text based extraction from job companies.

And write 3 articles about this content

1. How to use Dart and Flutter to generate a resume
2. github actions to automate the resume generation
3. refactoring the resume and parametrizing the resume generation with resuable functions. Make a package of this?
